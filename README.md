1.   当代青年价值观的分化与统合——基于流行语的分析（安徽师范大学马克思；博士学位论文；贾彦峰；2018）     

   ​         从阶层分化、代际分化、地域分化的角度去看当代青年价值观的分化。再分出小类去看每一类分化的特点。如阶层分化：血缘分层、姻缘分层、学缘分层、情缘分层。这些分化背后有着经济、文化、社会等体制性原因，也反映出思想政治教育理论和实践在快速发展中的弱点，因此要加强当代青年价值观的统合，如何统合？为何统合？作者也对统合的理论基础和方法做了解释。

2. 马来西亚国民中学初中华文教材中的价值观研究（华中师大；博士论文；2012）         

   ​        提出问题：华文教材中蕴含哪些价值观，分布是否合理？价值观通过怎么样的方式体现，呈现方式是否有效？体现的价值观内容是否符合课程预设的价值观教育要求？价值观内容对教师、学生与课堂教学等有何关系与影响？

3. 不同情境中道德判断的性别差异研究（湖南师范大学硕士论文）

   ​        本研究考察不同情境中道德判断的性别差异：不同性别的被试在不同情境中的道德判断，以及不同性别的道德判断主体对道德判断的影响。

4. 青少年学生生活满意度的结构和量表编制 

   ​    结合国外已有的生活满意度量表, 通过访谈、开放式问卷等方法, 构建了我国青少年学生生活满意度的理论维度, 并据此编制了青少年学生生活满意度量表。 对量表进行探索性因素分析和验证性因素分析后表明:生活满意度是一个多层次、多维度的结构, 包括2 个层次和 6 个维度。  

5. 中国不同发展水平城市间幸福指数差异及收入对其的影响作用  

   ​        对全国四种发展水平城市 5471 名被试的幸福感进行调查， 探讨不同发展水平城市居民幸福指数差异及收入对其的影响作用。  

6. Personal Values and Moral Foundations: Examining Relations and Joint Prediction of Moral Variables  

   ​        Support for values and foundations as unique constructs with consistent and theoretically meaningful relationships. Broadly, self-transcendence versus self enhancement values dimensions were associated with individualizing foundations, whereas conservation versus openness-to-change values dimensions were associated with binding foundations. 

   ​        Links between values and foundations categories followed the expected theoretical values theory circumplex structure sinusoidal pattern. Dimensions of the two theories predicted unique variance in morality attitudes, behavior, and individual differences.  

7. Personal values as motivational basis of psychological essentialism: An exploration of the value profile underlying essentialist beliefs  

   ​        Conservation values are associated with belief in genetic and metaphysical determinism, while self-transcendence and self-enhancement are associated with belief in social determinism.  

8. Personal values of lawbreakers  

   ​        Understanding what makes lawbreakers do what they do is an issue of major societal concern.   

   ​        It is found that the higher respondents score on the seriousness, the frequency, or the recency of lawbreaking behavior, the more they value stimulation and hedonism, and the less they feel guided by tradition, conformity, and peace of mind.  

9. Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases  2017

   ​        We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying
   and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.  

10. An Empirical Exploration of Moral Foundations Theory in Partisan News Sources  

    News sources frame issues in different ways in order to appeal or control the perception of their readers. We present a large scale study of news articles from partisan sources in the US across a variety of different issues. We first highlight that differences between sides exist by predicting the political leaning of articles of unseen political bias. Framing can be driven by different types of morality that each group values. We emphasize differences in framing of different news building on the moral foundations theory quantified using hand crafted lexicons. Our results show that partisan sources frame political issues differently both in terms of words usage and through the moral foundations they relate to.  

11. Personality in 100,000 Words: A large-scale analysis of personality and word use among bloggers

    ​        Previous studies have found systematic associations between personality and individual differences in word use. Such studies have typically focused on broad associations between major personality domains and aggregate word categories, potentially masking more specific associations. Here I report the results of a large-scale analysis of personality and word use in a large sample of blogs (N = 694). The size of the dataset enabled pervasive correlations with personality to be identified for a broad range of lexical variables, including both aggregate word categories and individual English words. The results replicated category-level findings from previous off-line studies, identified numerous novel associations at both a categorical and single-word level, and underscored the value of complementary approaches to the study of personality and word use.

12. Values Embodied in Children’s Literature used in Early Childhood Education in Israeli State Schools  2007

    ​        Societies can examine themselves and their values through examining their literature and the way they use literature in values education. This research investigated the values embodied in children's literature used by early childhood teachers in Israeli state schools. On the basis of questionnaires completed by 14 early childhood educators, and analysis of the official list of recommended children's books published by the Israeli Ministry of Education, the value ‘‘mutual respect and friendship’’ was found to be most prominent. Structural aspects of children's books were seen to emphasize the values the books convey.  

13. Values in Words: Using Language to Evaluate and Understand Personal Values 2013 

    ​        Our findings suggest that self-report questionnaires for abstract and complex phenomena, such as values, are inadequate for painting an accurate picture of individual mental life. Free response language data and language modeling show greater promise for understanding both the structure and content of concepts such as values and, additionally, exhibit a predictive edge over self-report questionnaires.   

14. An Overview of the Schwartz Theory of Basic Values

    ​      This article presents an overview of the Schwartz theory of basic human values

1. Gender Differences in Sexual Attraction and Moral Judgment: Research With Artificial Face Models 2018

   ​        Sexual attraction in humans is influenced by cultural or moral factors, and some gender differences can emerge in this complex interaction

2. Legitimation of value practices, value texts, and core values at public authorities  2019

   ​        A large number of Swedish public authorities produce ‘platform of values’ texts that present core values. This article addresses discursive transformations of contemporary organizations with a particular focus on available discursive space for critical thinking in the wake of New Public Management and related developments.  

3. Personal Values and Moral Foundations: Examining Relations and Joint Prediction of Moral Variables 2020

   ​        self-transcendence versus self-enhancement values dimensions were associated with individualizing foundations, whereas conservation versus openness-to-change values dimensions were associated with binding foundations. Links between values and foundations categories followed the expected theoretical values theory circumplex structure sinusoidal pattern. Dimensions of the two theories predicted unique variance in morality attitudes, behavior, and individual differences. 

4. Personal values of lawbreakers 2020

   ​       Understanding what makes lawbreakers do what they do is an issue of major societal concern. This paper studies
   how personal values are related to lawbreaking behavior.

5. Representation, justification, and explanation in a value‑driven agent: an argumentation‑based approach  2020

   ​        This paper takes a Value-Driven Agent (VDA) as an example, explicitly representing implicit knowledge of a machine learning-based autonomous agent and using this formalism to justify and explain the decisions of the agent.  

6. Semantics Derived Automatically From Language Corpora Contain Human-like Moral Choices   2019

   ​        For a given choice overall, the model’s bias score is the sum of the bias scores for all question/answer templates with that choice. We ran different choices through this analysis using a Universal Sentence Encoder. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and even moral choices. Our method holds promise
   for extracting, quantifying and comparing sources of moral choices in culture, including technology  

7. Shaping values with "YouTube freedoms": linguistic representation and axiological charge of the popular science IT-discourse  2019

   ​        The conducted research reveals that the texts of mass media about YouTube contain the following values, classified by the authors into three axiological groups: relevance (approval, authenticity, entertainment, fame, influence, popularity); relationship (accessibility, connection, feedback, relatability); profession (career, competitiveness, money, promotion, time). The results of the study include theoretical conclusions about how the modern-day discourse of information technology (IT-discourse) reflects both fundamental and profession-specific human values, thus shaping the way addressees perceive the industry through language. These findings make it possible to form a new type of IT-discourse text architecture, which would take into account the pragmatic-axiological charge necessary to shape and divert the set of addressees’ values.  

8. Teachers’ Self-Efficacy: The Role of Personal Values and Motivations for Teaching  2019

   ​        Based on Schwartz’s well-known theory of human values, this study sought to examine the relations between teachers’ values(i.e., conservation, openness to change, self-transcendence, and self-enhancement) and their self-efficacy.  

9. To be Liked or Feared: Honor-Oriented Men’s Sensitivity to Masculine Reputation Concerns Depends on Status-Seeking Strategy  2020

   ​        Research has focused heavily on men’s acquisition of repute as tough and masculine and their use of physical aggression for reputational defense, but much less is known about whether men display similar vigilance in managing their reputation for other elements of honor (e.g., loyalty, integrity).  

10. Research on the Value Orientation and Development of Contemporary “Martial Spirit" 2020

    ​        Chinese martial arts have a long history and a broad and profound cultural background. It is the essence of the Chinese nation's excellent cultural concentration and is respected as China's “national essence”. Through a comprehensive analysis of the historical development and changes of Chinese martial arts, this paper studies the various problems that martial arts have in school education, based on the contemporary people's demand for national culture, and the lack of the “spirit of martial arts” status, I want to wake up to sleep The spiritual wealth that has been in people's hearts for a long time: the “spirit of martial arts” has brought it back to life.   

11. The Role of Personal Values in Social Entrepreneurship 2020

    ​         The data was collected through social entrepreneurship and personal value scales. The results of the data analysis indicated the mean scores for pre-service teachers' perceptions for social entrepreneurship at mostly level, for self-control and intellectualism values at agreement level and religiousness, social skills and honesty values at moderate agreement level.

12. Relationship satisfaction and similarity of personality traits, personal values, and attitudes

    ​        Opposite-sex couples (624 individuals) expecting a child were recruited. Spouses were highly similar regarding their political attitudes and moderately similar regarding trait Openness and the personal values Universalism and Tradition. Similarity for other traits and values was weak (e.g. Conscientiousness, Power values) or non-existent (e.g. [Neuroticism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/neuroticism), Benevolence values). Similarity in conservative vs. liberal attitudes was non-linear: a conservative-conservative union was most common. Women's relationship satisfaction was related to similarity in left-right and liberal-conservative political attitudes, and both partners' satisfaction was related to similarity in Self-Direction values. Similarity in personality traits was unrelated to relationship satisfaction.

13. Subjective value fulfillment: A new way to study personal values and their consequences

    ​        We propose and test a theory of subjective value fulfillment. Participants from five samples reported their feelings of value fulfillment in general and in the context of specific identities: Student, Israeli, Arab, and Druze. Findings show that subjective value fulfillment has the same circular structure as value importance, but the two constructs differ extensively in their hierarchies. While hierarchies of value importance were similar across different identities in both the present study and prior reports, subjective value-fulfillment hierarchies differed in the present study, reflecting attributes of each identity. For most identities, subjective value fulfillment predicted well-being over and above value importance. The findings show that subjective value fulfillment can be a strong theoretical tool to study effects of social identities.

14. 价值观的稳定性与可变性：基于认知神经科学的视角   2017

    ​        从认知神经科学的角度来探讨导致价值观稳定性差异的机制问题  

15. 高中语文阅读教学对学生是非观的影响研究——以延安市实验中学为例（延安大学学科语文，硕士论文，白婷，2020）

    ​        通过问卷调查和教学实践来探究高中语文阅读教学对学生是非观的影响

16. 面向人工智能伦理计算的中文道德词典构建方法研究  2020 

    ​        该文提出了面向人工智能伦理计算的中文道德词典构建任务，设计了四类标签和四种类型，得到包含25,012个词的中文道德
    词典资源。

17. 教学价值取向的表征、差距与归因———对北方两省中小学教师的调查分析  2020

    ​        通过对 685 名中小学教师调查， 发现教师的教学价值取向具有 “后设取向”特征， 对 “伦理” “技术”“过程”“结果”“学生”与 “教师”等价值有较为均衡的认同和关注， 但教学价值取向在观念和行动层面存在一定程度的差距， 呈现出 “知易行难”的特点， 这种差距在 “学生”“伦理”和 “过程”取向上表现尤为明显; 城乡不同地区以及不同教育阶段的教师群体的教学价值取向存在差异; 教师倾向将观念和行动之间的差距主要归因于外部因素。

1. Individual Differences Facing the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Age, Gender, Personality, and Positive Psychology  2021

   ​        Research on individual differences in facing the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be crucial in order to design diverse and highly effective intervention strategies. This study uses a sample of 302 North American participants who were recruited through the crowdsourcing platform ProA; different profiles were established, profiling variables of interest in facing the COVID-19 outbreak. Socio-demographic and psychological (personality traits, gratitude, life purpose, and religiosity) variables were explored. These results are of interest if we want to deepen the study of individual differences at both a theoretical and applied level. 

2. Moral Judgments  2021

   This article offers a framework that distinguishes, theoretically and empirically, four classes of moral judgment: evaluations, norm judgments, moral wrongness judgments, and blame judgments. These judgments differ in their typical objects, the information they process, their speed, and their social functions. The framework presented here organizes the extensive literature and provides fresh perspectives on measurement, the nature of moral intuitions, the status of moral dumbfounding, and the prospects of dual-process models of moral judgment. It also identifies omitted questions and sets the stage for a broader theory of moral judgment, which the coming decades may bring forth.  

3. We’re all in this together, but for different reasons: Social values and social actions that affect COVID-19 preventative behaviors  

   ​        As expected, social focus values influenced the extent of compliance with these preventative behaviors, even when controlling for beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 and socio-demographics. We also examined the persuasiveness of four different value-expressive messages promoting social distancing, in a subsample of 737 Australian adults. We found that the message expressing self-transcendence values was ranked most persuasive by 77% of respondents.   

4. 道德困境研究的范式沿革及其理论价值  2021

   系统阐释了经典两难法、加工分离法、 CNI模型法和 CAN算法的优缺点和理论价值，为道德困境及相关研究提供了方法学参考。

5. 《四库全书》中进取的心理学指标和维度初探  2021

   ​        进取是根植于中华优秀传统文化中的心理品质，也是当代中国健全人格中的重要品质。进取品质主要包含希望、勇气、热情和自信四项指标，在多种角度呈现不同维度，可划分为修养自我、兴旺家业和建功立业，也可划分为力行而进、循序而进和以退为进，还 可划分为主动行事、坚持不懈、积极有为等维度，彰显了中国人自我发展和自我实现之特色。进取在历史文化下体现出与时代发展相 吻合的继承性和发展性，在中西方跨文化下体现出与文化相适应的相似性和差异性。  

6. [Reinventing the Universal Structure of Human Values: Development of a New Holistic Values Scale to Measure Indian Values](https://scholar.cnki.net/Detail/index/GARJ2021_1/SJIX947728F7D8BCF7B275B17C1C581A56F5) 2021

   ​        This article investigates the universal values scale, Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) for its applicability to measure cultural context-specific values. The study establishes a need to construct a new scale by identifying and incorporating Indian culture-specific values in SVS. Deriving data using self-assessment questionnaires from 709 respondents in 2 studies and analysing them using principal component analysis and structural equation modelling, the article reconceptualizes Schwartz’s Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) and the 10 motivational value factors and develops a new 76-item Holistic Values Scale (HVS) to measure Indian values using well-established scale development methods. The article further presents the research and policy implications and future research areas in this domain.

7. [Personality and Value Preference as Predictors of Social Well-being](https://scholar.cnki.net/Detail/index/GARJ2021_1/SJIX1359547E4DDC29540D317AA6C9855D62) 2021

   ​        This article explored the role of personality disposition and value preference as predictors of social well-being in the context of ecological setting. Ecological contexts like rural and urban are critical, particularly in a developing country like India, because they represent significant disparities and variations in the lived experiences of the people.

8. [Burnout Among Primary Government School Teachers: The Mediating Role of Work– Family Conflict](https://scholar.cnki.net/Detail/index/GARJ2021_1/SJIX13D16BC5D9EB5BDC9184DC6B426F62C5) 2021

   ​        Although the impact of job demands and work–family conflict (WFC) on burnout has been extensively discussed and analysed in the past literature, the role of WFC as a generative mechanism has been neglected. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the mediating effects of WFC between job demands and burnout. 

9. [Post-materialism’s Social Class Divide: Experiences and Life Satisfaction](https://scholar.cnki.net/Detail/index/GARJ2021_1/SJIXF32F5E65FAF823B33240E91175FF8501) 2021

     This article will show that such a divide occurs, first for participation in post-material experiences and second for the attainment of life satisfaction. Using data from the World Values Survey, evidence will be provided in this article showing that members of the working class participate less in post-material experiences than others and, as a consequence, enjoy lower life satisfaction than others, especially post-materialists. In light of working-class-supported right-wing populism’s recent emergence in the USA and Europe, this social class divide takes on a special significance in explaining shifting trends in politics and public policy.

10. Environmental values and identities at the personal and group level 2021

    ​        Environmental values and identities, at the personal and group level, motivate individuals’ climate actions. Many individuals report having strong environmental values and self-identities, and thus appear personally motivated to support and take climate action. To achieve society-wide climate action, we argue that it is critical to fully use this personal motivational base for climate action by, for instance, emphasizing the environmental benefits of climate actions and reminding people of their past pro-environmental actions. Individuals’ perceptions of others’ endorsement of environmental values are, however, more negative, which may inhibit consistent climate action. Making people aware that others also strongly value the environment could be a critical strategy to motivate climate action, particularly for individuals that are not strongly personally motivated.

11. Personal values in human life 2021
            Personal values are subjective in nature, and reflect what people think and state about themselves. Consequently, both researchers and laymen sometimes question the usefulness of personal values in influencing action. Yet, self-reported values predict a large variety of attitudes, preferences and overt behaviours. Individuals act in ways that allow them to express their important values and attain the goals underlying them. Thus, understanding personal values means understanding human behaviour.

12. Age and the subjective importance of personal values

    ​        Previous research has shown that persons' ratings of the importance of personal values are correlated with age: The older the persons, the more they favor conservation-related values, and the less they prioritize stimulation and change. We here take a closer look at these findings and show with four large representative surveys using two value scales that (1) all basic personal values are essentially linearly related to age; (2) stimulation/hedonism and power/achievement values drop in importance with increasing age, tradition-related values become more important, and self-transcendence values remain essentially stable; (3) the subjective importance of security remains stable at a high level for all age groups; (4) the rated importance of a personal value depends on the value's components addressed by the measurement instrument; (5) gender has essentially no effect on the age-value relation.
